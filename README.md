# Pygame Engine Example

An engine written for for a [series of articles on a IT site itnetwork.cz](https://www.itnetwork.cz/python/pygame/skakacka-v-pygame-engine-a-assety). Some of the articles are under premium ITNetwork license, so I am unable to publish the full source code. Still, this example is runnable by executing `python3 main.pyc`.

Gameplay video is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/BnidPnezdrE).

List of all assets which I used is available [here](https://github.com/esoadamo/pygame-engine-example-compiled/blob/master/attribution.md).
